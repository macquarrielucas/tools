## Speed Graph

This contains a class called `SpeedGraph` which will take in
an ODE and graph the phase plot and the time series of the 
chosen solutions. **The phase plot colours the solution based
on the magnitude of it's velocity.** It can also optionally
**attempt to plot the equilibria of the system**. 

These are things I found useful to know when studying models
for a undegraduate research project. Saves a lot of work when
studying various systems, perhaps you may find it useful
too. See the examples folder for an image.
